# COVIDashFlow

[![Made with Pthon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python-1f425f.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

A simple Apache Airflow project which works as the ETL of [COVIDash.it](https://www.covidash.it/)

## For developers
To see it in action have a MongoDB instance ready and populate the `.env` file with the appropriate value. Then 
```shell
docker-compose --env-file ./.env --build up
```
The Airflow Web UI will be listening at `http://0.0.0.0:8080`
It can be stopped with 
```shell
docker-compose down
```
